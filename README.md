This project loads json data from Unity's Resources folder to display on slides authored and serialized in Unity's editor.

Control of the slides is handled by the QuizManager service class. The current slide's view model communicates with the QuizManager class to change slides and grade the quiz.

This repository only contains the C# classes as the rest of the project is subject to licensing restrictions and cannot be included in a public repo.
